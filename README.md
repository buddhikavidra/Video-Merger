# Context

This is just a project I made because I couldn't find any efficient way to Merge two videos, without paying those Companies thousand of dollars. The tool is written in python and does a pretty straightforward job.

# Usage

Copy and Paste your video files in the Input Folder. Run the script using Start.bat. Let it do it's work. Check Output folder for the Merged Video.
